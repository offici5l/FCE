## About FCE

**FCE** is a tool to simplify the process of obtaining specific files from firmware packages. Instead of downloading a large ROM file (often several gigabytes), you can simply provide a direct download link and select the partition image you need. That file will then be extracted and a direct link provided for downloading it. This saves time and bandwidth.
